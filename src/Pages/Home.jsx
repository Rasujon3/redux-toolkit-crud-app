      <p>
        My goal has always been to be a Certified MERN Stack developer. Last 4-5
        months, I spent most of my time learning React JS, and I'm aiming to
        learning some new things in the upcoming days. I also hope to improve my
        communication and public speaking skills. That will be helps me to join
        the appropriate job sector as a full time MERN Stack developer. I really
        want to be a proactive and valuable team member at my company, wherever
        I work. I want to lead a team, so I will improve my leadership skills
        and gain more experience.
